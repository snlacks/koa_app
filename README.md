A really simple koa app.

I use this to prototype stuff.

If you are looking to use this, I recommend you read over the tsconfig.json and package.json to make sure it fits your needs. I removed some of my build scripts to simplify the public version. Feel free to open up any issues or PRs, or fork.

Instructions

Clone the repo.
npm install
npm test
npm start
